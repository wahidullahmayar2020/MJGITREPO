Exceptions
Are unwanted events that occurs during the execution of a program and prevents the
normal completion of a program
if we have a program that consists of 1000 lines if we encounter an exception at
line number 100 rest of the lines will be ignored an error message will be thrown
and program will terminate abruptly.
Exception handling:
1) we convert the system generated error messages to user friendly messages so that
a normal person can understand the issue
2) we provide a backup(we are not fixing the original problem)
Keywords in java to achieve exception handling
1) try
2) catch
3) finally
4) throws
5) throw
try:
try with {} brackets is used to wrap the problematic code that can cause an issues
at runtime
catch:
catch with () and {} brackets is used to catch the exceptions in the () we place
the name of the exception class and we create variable of that class
{} we place backup code
try{
FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream();
}catch( FileNotFoundException e ){
sout"File not found"
}
finally:
Finally block is used to execute the cleanup(code that release system resources)
code once we enter the try block this finally block is always executed even if we are
facing exceptions in the try block or the catch block
throws:
keyword is use to explicitly what type of exceptions can be thrown from
a specific method we use the throws keyword in the method header after
the parentheses and specify the names of the classes of exceptions that can be thrown
by that method
throw:
is used to throw an exception
finalize()
