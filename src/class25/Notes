MethodOverloading:
Method overloading is a mechanism through which we can define same method multiple times in
the same class but with different signature(name of the method and its parameters) to write
cleaner code.
1)Compiler-> checks for the syntax errors semantics
but not for runtime errors or logical errors
2) Java source code is converted to byte code
3) JVM converts the byte code to machine code and executes it
To overload a method or a constructor we must have the same name but different
number of parameters or different type of parameters or different sequence of parameters
we can overload private and static methods
we can overload constructor
we can overload main method
we can not overload a method by changing the return type
we overload methods in the same class
we can not overload by just changing the parameter names
Overriding
Overriding is a mechanism in java through which parent and child classes can have the same
methods if child class does not like the implementation from the parent class child class
can provide its own implementation and depending upon the object type proper method willl
be called
Overriding rules:
1)we can not override private constructors because they do not participate in inheritance
2) Static methods can not be overridden but we can re-declare them
3) To override we should have an inheritance relationship
4) the return type name and parameters of the method should be same
5) we can not decrease the visibility but we can increase it
